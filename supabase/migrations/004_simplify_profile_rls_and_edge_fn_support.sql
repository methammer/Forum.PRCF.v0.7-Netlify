      # Simplify Profile RLS and Support Edge Functions

      This migration revises the Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `public.profiles`
      table to align with the strategy of handling complex, hierarchical administrative
      operations (like an admin modifying another user's role or status) via
      Supabase Edge Functions.

      1.  **`profiles` Table RLS Simplification**:
          *   **SELECT Policy**: Retains the existing logic which allows users to see their own profile, and grants broader visibility to MODERATOR, ADMIN, and SUPER_ADMIN roles based on hierarchy.
          *   **INSERT Policy**:
              *   Admin creation of users is handled by the `create-user-admin` Edge Function.
              *   User self-registration is handled by the `handle_new_user` trigger.
          *   **UPDATE Policy**:
              *   A new, simpler "Profiles: Users can update their own profile" policy is ADDED. This allows users to modify fields on their own profile.
              *   CRITICAL: This policy *does not* prevent users from changing their own `role` or `status` if they could issue a direct SQL command. The primary enforcement for preventing self-change of `role`/`status` is through application logic (UI not offering these fields for self-edit) and dedicated Edge Functions for any `role`/`status` modifications.
              *   Administrative updates to other users' profiles (role, status, etc.) are handled by the `update-user-details-admin` Edge Function.
          *   **DELETE Policy**:
              *   Administrative deletion of users is handled by the `delete-user-admin` Edge Function.
              *   Users are generally not allowed to delete their own profiles directly via SQL.

      **Important Notes**:
      - This change signifies a shift in how administrative actions on profiles are authorized and executed.
      - Complex logic and sensitive field changes (like role/status) are moved to Edge Functions.
      - RLS policies on `profiles` are now simpler, focusing on self-service for non-sensitive fields and basic role-based visibility.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -- 1. DROP problematic/superseded policies from previous migrations for `profiles` table.
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: RBAC Select Policy" ON public.profiles;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: RBAC Insert Policy for Admins" ON public.profiles;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: RBAC Update Policy" ON public.profiles;

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles; -- Recreating
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Profiles: RBAC Delete Policy" ON public.profiles;


    -- 2. RECREATE/CREATE necessary simplified policies for `profiles`

    -- SELECT PROFILES
    CREATE POLICY "Profiles: RBAC Select Policy"
    ON public.profiles FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (
      (auth.uid() = profiles.id) OR -- Can always see own profile
      (
        (SELECT public.get_current_user_role()) = 'super_admin' -- SUPER_ADMIN can see all
      ) OR
      (
        (SELECT public.get_current_user_role()) = 'admin' AND
        lower(profiles.role::text) IN ('user', 'moderator', 'admin') -- ADMIN can see USER, MODERATOR, other ADMINs
      ) OR
      (
        (SELECT public.get_current_user_role()) = 'moderator' AND
        lower(profiles.role::text) = 'user' -- MODERATOR can see USERs (for moderation context)
      )
    );

    -- UPDATE PROFILES (Simplified for self-updates)
    -- Users can update their own profile.
    -- The restriction that users cannot change their own 'role' or 'status' via this policy
    -- is now primarily enforced by application logic (UI) and by routing all role/status
    -- changes through specific Edge Functions. This RLS policy, by itself, would allow
    -- a user to change their own role/status if they could issue a direct SQL update.
    CREATE POLICY "Profiles: Users can update their own profile"
    ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (
      auth.uid() = profiles.id
    ) WITH CHECK (
      auth.uid() = profiles.id
      -- The check "NEW.role = OLD.role AND NEW.status = OLD.status" was removed
      -- as NEW/OLD are not available in RLS check constraints in this manner.
      -- Preventing users from changing their own role/status is now primarily
      -- the responsibility of the application layer and dedicated Edge Functions.
    );

    -- NO EXPLICIT INSERT POLICY FOR PROFILES needed for users:
    -- - User self-registration: `handle_new_user` trigger creates the profile.
    -- - Admin creation: `create-user-admin` Edge Function.

    -- NO EXPLICIT DELETE POLICY FOR PROFILES needed for users:
    -- - Admin deletion: `delete-user-admin` Edge Function.
    -- - Self-deletion would also be an Edge Function if implemented.

    /*
      Note on other tables (`sections`, `topics`, `posts`):
      Their RLS policies are assumed to be largely unaffected by this specific change
      to `profiles` RLS strategy.
